=== NEW
-Update SIDE control to blue button
-Add track recordArm functionality to record over loaded loops

- Remove TimeObserver obligation from Looper, not needed as GridLogic handles Time now

- Add AudioBuffer soundfile writer in order to check contents (looper distortion bug)

- Update GUI threading to become controller independant, allowing a
ControllerUpdater instance run in the UI thread, updating each Controller
subclass instance. This affords OSC user-interfaces, as well a the GUI, as well
as future controllers.
    - thread per Controller
    - deriving from TimeManager etc not possible, should they be functions in
      Controller, so that moving a class from RT to non-RT won't = code change

=== IN PROGRESS



=== COMPLETED

- Interface / Logic class for all Luppp engines actions
Needed to give Controller classes a way to tell Luppp what to do.
This class must update all controllers based on state. Essentially
its like "GridLogic", but for the rest of the functionality.

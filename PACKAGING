Thanks for looking into packaging Luppp:
OpenAV couldn't possibly package for every distro,
your work is apprecatied!


CMake is used as the build system, checkout the compile.sh
script in the 'build' directory: its pretty simple.


Notes for packaging:

=== 1: luppp.prfs
Install luppp.prfs into .config/openAV/luppp/

Result: file:   .config/openAV/luppp/luppp.prfs


=== 2: Controllers directory
Install controllers directory (and contents) to
.config/openAV/luppp/

Result: dir:    .config/openAV/luppp/controllers/
        files:  .config/openAV/luppp/controllers/<filename>.ctlr

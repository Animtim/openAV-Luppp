/** GridLogic
 *  The logic code for the luppp tracks / grid resides here. This logic is
 *  separtated from the Looper class so it can be repurposed by different
 *  controllers and input devices. The UI and eg. APC / Launchpad all have a
 *  similar grid style interface: implementing the logic in each is not good.
 * 
 *  The class sends Looper messages to change its state, thus abstracting away
 *  the details of the Looper control, and exposing its functionality using a
 *  convinient API.
 * 
 *  When the state of a block changes, it will update the state of the grid on
 *  the controller.
 * 
 *  It inherits from TimeObserver so it can change the state of the clip on the
 *  bar / beat.

/** This is a controller using TCC as a backend, which reads .c files
 * as "scripts", but compiles them on the fly and then hooks in the
 * poll / handle event loop into the controller itself.
 *
 * It is designed to be a flexible way of prototyping support for any
 * MIDI/HID devices. Once a controller file is concidered "finished",
 * it may be sent as a pull request for inclusion in vanilla Luppp.
 *
 * As TCC is only a C compiler (as opposed to C++) this layer translates
 * Luppps internal events (which are C++ classes) to native C structs,
 * which can then be passed to the TCC compiled C backend. Ideally the
 * Luppp internal event handling system would be ported to plain C,
 * however this would also require significant effort, which does not
 * seem worth the time at the moment.

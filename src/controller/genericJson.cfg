Luppp Generic MIDI controller template

the Name of the controller is specified by <filename>.cfg. Use a lower-case first
letter, it is capitalized in the UI by Luppp automatically.

<lupppActionString> is a list of string-ified actions available in Logic / GridLogic
This list contains all "bindable" controls available to MIDI controllers. 

In events where multiple inputs are available, (eg "trackVolume") the "track" part
is appended to the action string, "trackVolume1".
Indices for these action strings range from 0 to n-1.

ALL "value"-s are assumed to be 0-127, and will be range scaled to Luppp's internal
range automatically.

Each "control" object has a "status" (the first byte of MIDI message) and "data" (the
second byte). The 3rd byte is interpreted as the "value" to be used.
